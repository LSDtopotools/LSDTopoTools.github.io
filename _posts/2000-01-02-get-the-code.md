# Start using LSDTopoTools

**LSDTopoTools** works on _any_ operating system. The best way to start is to read the documentation of our [introductory workshop](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/). Before you do anything, you will need to download and install (in this order) [VirtualBox] (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). These are both free and open source software packages that work on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

We regularly release stable versions of the package in conjunction with the release of
papers. These versions are hosted on our [Github pages](https://github.com/LSDtopotools) and
allow the reproduction of our analysis from each paper.

As the software is constantly evolving and being used to perform cutting edge research
our main repository is held on a private github repository. If you are interested in accessing the latest development
build please contact the lead developer Simon Mudd (simon.m.mudd _at_ ed.ac.uk).
