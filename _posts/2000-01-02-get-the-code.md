# Start using LSDTopoTools

As the software is constantly evolving and being used to perform cutting edge research
our main repository is held on a secure server. For access to the latest development
build please contact the lead developer Simon Mudd (simon.m.mudd _at_ ed.ac.uk) for access.

We regularly release stable versions of the package in conjunction with the release of
papers. These versions are hosted by [CSDMS](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page) and
allow the reproduction of our analysis from each paper.
