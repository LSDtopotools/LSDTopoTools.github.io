# Start using LSDTopoTools

**LSDTopoTools** works on _any_ operating system. The best way to start is to read the documentation of our [installation instructions](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html) and then move on to [our first examples](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_basic_usage.html). You can install natively on Linux, or you can use either [Vagrant and Virtual Box](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant) or [Docker](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_docker) on any operating system. 

We regularly release stable versions of the package in conjunction with the release of
papers. These versions are hosted on our [Github pages](https://github.com/LSDtopotools) and
allow the reproduction of our analysis from our scientific papers.

As the software is constantly evolving and being used to perform cutting edge research
our main repository is held on a private github repository. If you are interested in accessing the latest development
build please contact the lead developer Simon Mudd (simon.m.mudd _at_ ed.ac.uk).

We also have python scripts to [visualise LSDTopoTools output](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_visualisation.html)

## Current Releases

Many of our software releases have their own doi. See our [zenodo page for citable packages](https://zenodo.org/communities/lsdtopotools)

Below is a list of github repositories that store differnt LSDTopoTools components, along with the relevant papers. 

If you use our code in a scientific paper please cite the relevant package using the [zenodo doi](https://zenodo.org/communities/lsdtopotools) and if appropriate the paper that introduced the algorithms.
