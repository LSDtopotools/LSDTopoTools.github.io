# Strat using LSDTopoToolBox

As the software is constantly evolving and being used to perform cutting edge research
our main repository is held on a secure server. For access to the latest development
build please contact the lead developer [Simon Mudd](smudd@staffmail.ed.ac.uk) for access. 

We regularly release stable versions of the package in conjunction with the release of
papers. These versions are hosted by [CSDMS][http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page] and
allow the reproduction of our analysis from each paper.
