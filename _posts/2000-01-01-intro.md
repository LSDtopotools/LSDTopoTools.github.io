Welcome to LSDTopoTools. This software was developed by members of the [Land Surface
Dynamics (LSD) research group](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface-dynamics) at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).

The software aims to operate:

* As a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.
* As a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.
* As a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes.
* To improve the speed and performance of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).
* To enable **reproducible** topographic analysis in the research context.

This software is constantly used for research and is regularly updated with new routines. Some
popular techniques already implemented include:

* [Basic topographic analysis](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver)
* [Channel network extraction from LiDAR data](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction)
* [Chi analysis](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014)
* [Calculation of erosion rates from cosmogenic nuclides](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide)
* [Hilltop flow routing, and hillslope relief metrics](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_Hillslope_Analysis)
* [Topographic extraction of floodplains and terraces](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_FloodplainTerraceExtraction)

For an overview of some of the features of LSDTopoTools, see this poster, presented at the [2015 BSG Conference](http://geomorphology.org.uk/annual_general_meetings):
