Welcome to LSDTopoTools. This software was developed by members of the Land Surface
Dynamics (LSD) research group at the University of Edinburgh.

The software aims to operate:

* As a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.
* As a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.
* As a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes.
* To improve the speed and performance of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).
* To enable **reproducible** topographic analysis in the research context.

This software is constantly used for research and is regularly updated with new routines. Some
popular techniques already implemented include:

* [Channel network extraction from LiDAR data](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_docs/html/channel_heads.html)
* [Chi analysis](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_docs/html/chi_profiles.html)
* [River swath profiles](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_docs/html/swath_profiles.html)
* [Hilltop flow routing](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_docs/html/basin_metrics.html)
* [Generating E* R* data](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~smudd/LSDTT_docs/html/ER_Star.html)

For an overview of the software see this poster, presented at the [2015 BSG Conference](http://geomorphology.org.uk/annual_general_meetings):
