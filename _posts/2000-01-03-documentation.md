# Documentation

If you are just starting, you should read the documentation for our [introductory workshop](https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/). 

If you want more details, you should look at our [full user guide](http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/).

Our API which documents the code provides lower level guidance to users who wish to contribute 
to the software package can be found [here](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html)

The latest updates to the code can be seen by looking at our [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/LSDTopoTools), which is run by a [dangerous AI](https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTweet) that is developing a mind of its own.
