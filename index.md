Documentation for the LSDTopoToolBox
====================================================================

This documentation is for the Topographic Toolbox developed by the `Land Surface Dynamics (LSD) Group
<http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/research/globalchange/group3/>`_
at the 
University of Edinburgh's 
`School of GeoSciences
<http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/>`_.


Note this is a user guide and *not* documentation of the API. 
The detailed documentation of the software including objects, member functions and variables may be found at the 
`Source code documentation site
